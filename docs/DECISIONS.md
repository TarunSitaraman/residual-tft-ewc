# Design decisions

Methodological decisions for the data pipeline and evaluation, with the reasoning behind each and any open confirmation. Each entry states where the decision is implemented so results in the paper can be traced to code.

Status values: **Adopted** (in use), **Pending confirmation** (in use as the default, awaiting the data owner), **Planned** (agreed, not yet implemented).

## D1. Model input features: 18, not 22

**Status:** Pending confirmation (Darshan)

`DATA_DICTIONARY.csv` documents **27** columns (the README previously said 28). Excluding identifiers and RPT/health columns leaves **18** model inputs:

| Group | Columns |
|---|---|
| Cycle count | `Cycle_Index` |
| Voltage | `Voltage_Mean`, `Voltage_Min`, `Voltage_Max` |
| Current | `Current_Mean`, `Current_Min`, `Current_Max` |
| Temperature | `Temperature_Mean`, `Temperature_Min`, `Temperature_Max` |
| Capacity | `Charge_Capacity_Max`, `Discharge_Capacity_Max` |
| Energy | `Charge_Energy_Max`, `Discharge_Energy_Max` |
| Power | `Power_Mean` |
| Ratios | `Capacity_Ratio_Mean`, `Energy_Efficiency_Mean` |
| Data volume | `Data_Points` |

Excluded:

- **Identifiers / time:** `Battery_ID`, `Cycling_Test`, `Cycle_Date` (used for grouping, ordering and splitting).
- **RPT / health columns:** `RPT`, `RPT_Number`, `Capacity_Ah`, `Reference_Capacity_Ah`, `SOH_Percent`, `Days_Since_RPT`. These are the target or derived from the RPT join, so using them as inputs would leak the target.

The earlier "22 features" wording is treated as outdated or as a different counting convention. The code never hard-codes the count: notebook 03 derives it from the dictionary and the observed files.

**Implemented in:** `src/data_pipeline.py` (`HEALTH_COLUMNS`, `ID_COLUMNS`, `identify_cycling_features`, `model_feature_columns`), `notebooks/03_feature_engineering.ipynb` §3.

## D2. Point-level data is profiled only

**Status:** Adopted

`cleaned_battery_data.csv` is point-level and is not described by the data dictionary. The modelling datasets are already aggregated per cycle, so the point-level file is only profiled (in chunks) for size, coverage and missingness.

It must not be used directly for modelling until a separate point-level feature-extraction pipeline is defined, documented and validated against `final_battery_cycling_features.csv`.

**Implemented in:** `src/data_pipeline.py` (`LARGE_FILES`, `profile_csv_chunked`), `notebooks/01_data_ingestion.ipynb` §4.

## D3. Same-day RPTs recorded as a date only

**Status:** Pending confirmation (data owner)

Each cycle is aligned to the most recent RPT **on or before** its `Cycle_Date` (backward as-of join per battery). When `Test_Date` has no time of day, pandas reads it as 00:00. What a date-only RPT means physically is not documented; it could be:

| Setting (`date_only_rpt`) | Meaning | Effect on a cycle later the same day |
|---|---|---|
| `"start"` (default) | RPT applies from the start of its day (timestamps as stored) | Uses that RPT |
| `"end"` | RPT applies from the end of its day | Uses the previous RPT |
| `"unknown"` | Time of the RPT is unknown | Flagged as ambiguous; not judged either way in validation |

RPTs that carry a time of day are never shifted. Only cycles on the calendar day of a date-only RPT are affected.

The default `"start"` matches the handover rule applied to timestamps as stored. Notebook 03 §6.1 counts the affected cycles and shows which conventions the stored datasets are consistent with. The team still has to confirm which convention is physically correct; if it is not `"start"`, the aligned datasets must be regenerated.

**Implemented in:** `src/data_pipeline.py` (`effective_rpt_time`, `same_day_as_date_only_rpt`, `align_to_rpt`, `validate_rpt_alignment`, `validate_training_subset`), `notebooks/03_feature_engineering.ipynb` §1 (`DATE_ONLY_RPT`) and §6.1.

## D4. SOH labels repeat between RPTs; persistence is a reference only

**Status:** Adopted

SOH is measured only at RPTs, so every cycle between two RPTs carries the same label. Two consequences:

1. **Persistence is never selected as the best model.** Predicting each battery's last training SOH is a useful reference, but it can score zero validation error when the validation window sits inside the last training RPT interval. That score says nothing about later life. Model selection considers learned models only.
2. **RPT overlap is reported.** For each battery, notebook 04 reports the share of test rows whose RPT interval was already seen in training (`test_rows_in_train_rpt_%`) and the number of distinct RPTs in the test period (`test_distinct_rpts`). Scores on overlapping rows partly measure interpolation within a known health state.

A stricter follow-up is to split on RPT boundaries or to evaluate on RPT-level targets.

**Implemented in:** `notebooks/04_baseline_model.ipynb` §3 and §6.

## D5. Evaluation: within-battery baseline, sequential groups for continual learning

**Status:** Baseline adopted; continual-learning protocol planned

The baseline splits each battery chronologically (70 % train / 15 % validation / 15 % test, no shuffling). Every battery appears in training, so it measures **later-life prediction**, not generalisation to an unseen battery group.

The continual-learning stage will introduce battery groups sequentially and, after each new group, report:

- **Adaptation:** performance on the newly introduced group.
- **Retention:** performance on every previously seen group.
- **Forgetting:** the drop on each earlier group relative to its score at earlier checkpoints.

All metrics are reported per battery group (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²).

**Implemented in:** `src/data_pipeline.py` (`temporal_split`, `check_split_ordering`, `metrics_by_group`), `notebooks/04_baseline_model.ipynb`. Continual-learning protocol: to be implemented in `src/continual_learning.py`.

## D6. Data location and execution

**Status:** Adopted

Datasets are never stored in Git. Notebooks read from `DATA_ROOT` (default `data/`, relative to the repository root) and stop with an explicit error listing any missing file. No substitute data is generated.

In the cloud runtime all seven CSVs, including `DATA_DICTIONARY.csv`, are mounted under one directory, for example:

```bash
export DATA_ROOT=/mnt/project-data
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/01_data_ingestion.ipynb --output-dir /tmp/executed
```

Executed notebooks go to an output directory so data-derived outputs are not committed. Only small `results/*.json` files (metrics, configuration, preprocessing table) may be versioned.

**Implemented in:** `src/data_pipeline.py` (`resolve_data_root`, `check_data_files`), `data/README.md`, `.gitignore`.
